The following guideline has been established on a procedure of revoking the driving privileges of a member.  A Department of Motor Vehicles check will be done on each member every year.  This report is to be secured in the Chief’s Office and will be reviewed by a Chief Officer only.  This report should reflect no more than two Class B and no Class A violations in a three-year period.  Drivers should voluntarily report any personal violations received.  The following will be the policy on violations.

An individual who has more than three moving violation convictions or three chargeable accidents or any combination of more than three of the formerly stated violations in a three-year period will be issued a suspension of driving department apparatus for a period of one year.
