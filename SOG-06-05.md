The purpose of this guideline is to assure the efficient operation of personnel on the fire ground while maintaining the highest level of safety for all personnel.  

This guideline will apply to all personnel operating at the scene of any emergency incident.  

All personnel have an individual responsibility for adherence to this guideline.  Overall, responsibility for enforcement of this guideline rests with the company officer and/or the incident commander.  Authority to deviate from this guideline rest solely with the Incident Commander who bears full responsibility for the results of any deviations. 

For the safety of all personnel on the fire ground and for the efficient fire ground operations, it is imperative that the number and location of all personnel be known.  To accomplish this, the following guideline will be used&colon;  
* All personnel shall operate on the fire ground in accordance with established guideline.
* Personnel not assigned a specific task by established guidelines shall not operate on the fire ground without an assignment from the incident command or a company officer.  
* Personnel responding to the emergency scene shall report to their assigned company apparatus whenever possible.  
* Whenever possible, companies shall remain intact and all personnel shall work in the same area.  If the company must be split up to perform required functions, the company officer must maintain control of all members.  
* Whenever possible, company officers must know the location of all personnel in the company at all times.  There shall be no transfer of personnel from one company to another on the fire ground without positive communication between the two company officers.  Once a transfer has occurred, the transferred personnel shall remain with the company until positive communication between the officers again affects transfer.  
* Other officers in the fire ground shall avoid giving orders directly to firefighters operating as part of a different company.  Whenever orders must be given directly to firefighters their officer must also be informed of the assignments.  
* All personnel entering a structure or other hazardous area with self-contained breathing apparatus shall be equipped with an operating PASS device. 
An Access Control Officer (ACO) when manpower is available shall be assigned to monitor access to all structures and confined spaces, which personnel have entered.  Personnel shall not be permitted to enter these areas without a specific assignment.  Personnel entering the structure will present an ID tag to the ACO (unless the Onsite program is in use).  The ACO shall record the name or number of all personnel entering the area along with the time of entry and the air pressure contained in the SCBA.  
* All personnel exiting a structure or confined space shall report to the ACO that they have safely exited and obtain their I.D. tag. Whenever possible, personnel shall exit at the same point they entered.  If the ACO and/or Accountability Officer has not recorded the exit or movement of any firefighter within the time frame required to exhaust the air supply in the SCBA, the emergency signal, one solid blast of the air horns for a period of 10 seconds for a missing firefighter will be transmitted.  A PAR will be requested.  All company officers shall immediately account for all personnel assigned to them and report their finding to the ACO.  An immediate search shall be initiated in accordance with established search patterns for any missing personnel.  
* If manpower is not available to assign an ACO, an accountability board will be placed at every entrance point of the structure.  Personnel entering the structure will hang their I.D. tag into the board before entering.  All personnel will exit the structure at the same point as they enter and will obtain their I.D. tag.  If it is not possible to exit at the same point, it is the responsibility of each personnel to go to the point of entrance and obtain their tag.  These steps must be followed to maintain a status on personnel inside the structure.  
* Personnel shall not operate outside of their assigned company or sector. Personnel without an assignment shall report to their company apparatus or other established staging area to await assignment.
