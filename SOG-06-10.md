Lockout/ tag out is required for all personnel who may have to operate at an emergency scene if any procedure could involve either patient or member of the Dayville Fire Company exposure to live electrical parts or exposure to stored energy source on any machinery equipment.  

Whenever a situation is encountered that meets the above criteria upon arrival at a scene, the Dayville Fire Company personnel shall check to see if building/ plant personnel or company personnel have begun Lockout/ Tag Out procedure.  If they have begun the procedure then the Dayville Fire Company locked or tags hall be added to the ones already present.  

If Lockout/ Tag out procedures have not been initiated, then the Dayville Fire Company personnel will initiate the guideline.  Notify all affected personnel that a Lockout/ Tag out procedure is required and the reason why (i.e. emergency).  With the assistance of the building/ plant personnel shut down the equipment using the normal shut- down procedure if you can assure that the person entangled will not be hurt any further.  

Operate the disconnect switch, valve, circuit breaker or any other energy isolating device(s) so that the equipment is isolated from its energy source.  Toggle switches, push button and other types of control switches are not isolating devices.  

Dissipate and isolate all stored energy (if applicable) such as that found in springs, elevated machine members, rotating parts, hydraulic systems, and air, gas, steam and water pressure.  All stored energy must be dissipated or restrained by methods such as repositioning, blocking, bleeding down, etc.  

Lockout the energy isolation devices with energy lockout device(s) issued to personnel for lockout/ tag out procedures.  

If it is impossible to use a lock, another positive means of disconnecting the circuit or equipment must be used.  Other positive means may include unplugging, disconnecting the conductors, or removing fuses.  A tag must be placed on the plug, conductor, fuse brackets, etc.  If no positive means can be used placing a radio- equipped firefighter at the controls to keep the machine/ equipment from being activated shall be used.  

Only after the equipment has been properly locked/ tagged out shall emergency personnel begin to work to remove the entangled patient.  Always try to have a representative of the company where the incident is located to assist you with their expertise on the equipment.  

Once the disentanglement of the patient has been completed, the equipment shall remain locked/ tagged out until proper notifications, investigations, have been completed.  A photograph of the lock/ tag out equipment shall be taken for evidence purposes before removal.  

This guideline applies to all members of the Dayville Fire Company.
