The number one priority for the Dayville Fire Company is its member’s safety.  This guideline is being issued to set rules on jobs being performed in the station.  

It is every member’s responsibility to perform every task in the safest manner possible.  Each member will wear any equipment necessary to accomplish the job.  

The following requirements are mandatory and must be followed&colon;
* When it becomes necessary to clean the Oil Separator two members must be present.  No one shall go below floor level with any parts of their body other than their arms.
* Eye protection will be worn when operating any power tools, striking devices, impact tools, and working under apparatus.  (i.e. Installing and removing chains, bleeding air tanks.)

Each member will use judgement on wearing gloves to protect their hands.

**REMEMBER&colon; SAFETY FIRST**
