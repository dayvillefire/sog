This guideline is provided to establish where and how the apparatus will be fueled and/or refueled.  

At any time when the fire apparatus being driven has less than 3/4 of a tank of fuel or at the driverâ€™s discretion it will be taken and filled. R-163 and S-163 will be filled when they have less than 1/2 tank of fuel.  Each officer has a card which will be used to operate the pump.
