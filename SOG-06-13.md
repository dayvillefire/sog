OPERATION
---------

Ground ladders shall be deployed at all incidents involving crews working within an I.D.L.H. atmosphere above the ground floor of a structure.  

When possible, multiple sides of the structure can be laddered to increase the means of emergency egress.  

Once a ladder has been placed in a position where it is intended to be used as a means of egress, it shall not be moved for any reason until the conclusion of the incident.  

When working off a selected position on a ground ladder, a leg lock or an approved Class II harness shall be used.  

When laddering for roof operations, roof ladders shall be deployed on any roof with a pitch to decrease potential falls as well as increase footing during operations.  

TRAINING
--------

All personnel expected to partake in ground ladder shall be required to participate in at least one ground ladder training drill annually.  

MAINTENANCE
-----------

All ground ladders shall be inspected on a monthly basis and after each use. Inspections shall include all stationary as well as moving parts of the ladder.  Inspections shall include rails, beams, rivets butt spurs, pawls, rungs, and halyards. 

Following a thorough inspection, a thorough cleaning should be done.  Extension ladders will not operate properly if covered in soot and road grime.   A mild soap with water shall be used.  If ladders are to be power washed, assure that all stickers are not washed off.

TESTING
-------

Annual ladder testing shall be completed in accordance with N.F.P.A. 1932 Standard of Fire Department Ground Ladder Testing.  The Chief of the Dayville Fire Company shall be responsible for scheduling and selecting a company to complete annual testing.
