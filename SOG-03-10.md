DUTIES OF AN OFFICER
--------------------

Officers have three general areas on which they will be evaluated&colon;

* **Training** – Your level of training as well as the training you provide and facilitate for your subordinates.
* **Management/Command** – Taking care of personnel issues, as well as commanding at scenes and functioning within the chain of command
* **Discipline** – Appropriately handling disciplinary issues, as well as providing discipline where necessary.

Officers serve at the discretion of their immediate supervisor, with the Fire Chief having the ultimate authority.

EDUCATION
---------

All officers will participate in a minimum of a single classroom-format continuing education class annually, outside of the station’s required classes or their continuing medical education requirements.

Officers who hold instructor certifications may be requested to teach certain classes, in addition to scheduled drills; teaching participation in these classes may impact their next evaluation.

DUTY NIGHTS
-----------

Each night from 19&colon;00 – 07&colon;00 shall be referred to as a “duty night”, during which time a single officer will be assigned to respond to any emergency responses with an apparatus.

Duty night officers shall maintain a response time of under four minutes to have an apparatus sign on the air for any medical response. Duty night officers do not have to staff the firehouse unless they are unable to maintain these response times.

Duty night officers are responsible for a house inspection, which shall document the state of the firehouse, and will be submitted to the Fire Chief’s mailbox prior to the conclusion of the duty night.

Duty night officers are responsible for the state of the firehouse, including all persons coming or going from the firehouse, any lights left on, or any doors left non-secured. Duty officers are responsible for any persons staffing the firehouse overnight and may reserve the right to deny members the ability to staff a duty night, although this can be appealed to a Captain or Chief.

If any duty officer shift coverage changes, the Captain of the officer’s company and all Chiefs will be informed before the commencement of the duty night. Any substitute coverage requires that the officer covering performs all aforementioned duties for that duty night including a house inspection.

OFFICERS’ MEETINGS
------------------

Once a month, the Fire Chief will convene a mandatory attendance Officers’ Meeting to discuss leadership, training, and disciplinary matters with the officer corps. The meeting is open to line officers, engineers, chiefs, or anyone else deemed appropriate by the Fire Chief. Attendance and minutes will be kept at these meetings and stored in the department’s training record system.

The Fire Chief may designate additional training or drill days to be mandatory or suggested training days for officers.

CHAIN OF COMMAND
----------------

All officers will report to their immediate superior, or if their immediate superior is unavailable in a timely manner, another officer with equal rank. If they are not able to resolve their issue with that officer, they may bring the issue up another level in the chain of command until they reach a resolution.
When an issue is resolved, a copy of the disciplinary action form will be given to the Deputy Chief and the Fire Chief, and all superior officers will be informed. Officers should try to handle issues within their span of control and should inform their superiors.

PERIODIC EVALUATION
-------------------

All officers shall be given periodic performance evaluations twice yearly. Evaluations shall be conducted by an officer’s immediate superior, with the exception of the Fire Chief, who will conduct performance surveys on his performance in their stead. Evaluation instruments shall be common to all officers. 

These instruments shall include&colon;

* Expectations for performance improvement;
* Acknowledgement of exemplary performance;
* Ability to perform self-assessment to compare to officers’ assessment;
* Space for feedback from both officer and their superior;
* SWOT analysis;
* Short-term and long-term goals for the officer.

All officers with non-satisfactory reviews will be given until the next scheduled review to have their performance remediated. Any officer who is not evaluated by their superior may be demoted.

OFFICER PROGRAM REFERENCE
