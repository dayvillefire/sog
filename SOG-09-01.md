The Dayville Fire Company recognizes the potential exposure of its members to communicable diseases in the performance of their duties and under normal work environments.  The Dayville Fire Company is committed to a program that will reduce this exposure to a minimum and will implement an infection control program.   

This infection control program includes&colon;

1. Initial training and continuing education in infection control.  Such training will be done continually on an informal basis and annually on a formal basis.  
2. Immunization program- All members will be immunized against Hepatitis B or will sign a declination statement after being informed of the medical ramifications of not receiving such immunization.  
3. Protective equipment and clothing will be provided for use of all members.  
4. Provisions for decontaminating equipment and clothing.  
5. Provisions for proper disposal of regulated waste.  
6. Provisions for reporting and tracking exposures which will include a guarantee of confidentiality.  
7. Preservation of records (a) training records for 3 years and (b) medical records for the tenure of the person plus 30 years.  

The Dayville Fire Company will honor all universal precautions i.e. every patient must be considered infectious.  Blood and body fluids precautions are to be taken with all patients.  

The Dayville Fire Company believes that infectious disease exposure shall be considered an occupational health hazard and should the presumption that contracting contagious disease should be considered an occupational related condition.  

The Dayville Fire Company will meet full implementation of this plan by December 23, 1993.  It also understands that additional and deletions to this plan and its guidelines may be necessary.

An incident report will be filled out on the proper form and sealed in an envelope to the attention of the Senior Medical Officer.  All such records are confidential and will be kept in a locked file.  All exposed personnel will be offered a post exposure evaluation and follow up with a physician.  This follow up will include the following&colon;

2. After consent is obtained, the blood of the source individual will be tested for HIV/ HBV infectivity.  
3. Results of the testing of the source individual will be made available to the exposed member.  Confidentiality of the identity of the source individual is protected by Connecticut state law and will not be disclosed.  
4. Offering to the exposed member the option of having their blood collected for testing of their own HIV? HBV (HBSAB) status.  If the person does not consent to HIV testing, the sample shall be preserved for 90 days.  If within the 90 days of the exposure incident, the person chooses to have the baseline sample tested; such testing shall be done as soon as possible.  
5. If the source individual is HIV positive or an unknown source, the exposed member shall submit to a baseline test and a retest at 3 months, 6 months and 12 months. During this time, the person will be counseled not to donate blood, not to become pregnant and to practice safe sex.  
	
The exposed member will be referred to Day Kimball Hospital for post exposure prophylaxis if indicated.  

The Senior Medical Officer will provide the exposed member a copy of the post exposure evaluation written opinion within 15 days of the exposure incident.  This shall be limited to&colon;

1. Indication for Hepatitis B vaccine/ receipt of vaccine.  
2. Informed of the results of the evaluation. 
3. Informed of any medical conditions resulting from exposure which require further evaluation or treatment.

An Assistant Chief Officer will also be the Inspection Control Officer and will be responsible for all personnel medical files and Hepatitis B vaccine records.
