3. A member with no or limited experience in firefighting, rescue, emergency medical services, or fire police work.

REQUIREMENTS
------------

New members will be designated as probationary members/firefighters for the first six months. A probationary period may be shortened at the discretion of the Fire Chief including, but not limited to, possessing previous experience through active participation in a fire department or having been training and certified in appropriate course work.

Probationary members/firefighters are expected to&colon;
1. Attend 90% or more of the meetings and training sessions held during their probationary period.
2. Respond to calls after having completed&colon;
   i)    Bloodborne pathogen training
   ii)   Airborne pathogen training
   iii)  HIPAA training
3. Must complete within the first 60 days (with time extensions made if the classes are not able to be offered within the requisite time period)&colon;
   i)    Onboarding
   ii)   AHA BLS CPR training
   iii)  ICS 100, 200, 700, and 800
   iv)   Sexual harassment training
4. Meet active membership status by responding to 10% of all calls on a monthly basis

Probationary members/firefighters will be assigned a Lieutenant from the company to which they have been assigned as a mentor. If a Lieutenant from their company is not available, another Lieutenant will be assigned as a mentor. That officer’s responsibilities include&colon;

1. Minimum of a monthly informal meeting discussing progress, goals, any difficulties, and accomplishments. This meeting may be conducted by phone or tele/video conference.
2. Three and six month formal reviews of the probationary member/firefighter
3. Monthly report on the new member’s progress at the Officers’ Meeting.

Probationary members/firefighters will be issued different duty shirts than full members, which will identify them as probationary members/firefighters.

At the end of the probationary period, the Fire Chief, with input from the officer corps, will make the decision to do one of the following&colon;

1. Accept the member as a full member
2. Extend the probationary period
3. Remove the member from the department

In the event that the probationary member is a junior/cadet, that member would be considered a junior/cadet member at the end of their probationary period, not a full member.

If the requirements of the probationary period have not been met, the probationary period may be extended up to one year. If, after one year, the probationary member has not met the requirements to complete probation, the member may be terminated.

Graduation from the probationary program will be announced after weekly drill by the member’s supervising company Captain, or one of their Lieutenants or one of his/her designees. The member will receive a certificate of completion, a company patch, and a duty shirt.
