approved: "05-25-2011"
purpose: "To establish a guideline for responding to Natural Gas Emergencies."
---

Natural gas (Methane) is colorless, treated with an odor detector, lighter than air- rises and may be more predominant in the upper levels of a structure.

GUIDELINES
----------

Natural gas is lighter than air and will usually dissipate in the outside environment.  Flammable limits are approximately 4% to 15% in air.  Natural gas itself is non- toxic, however, it displaces oxygen and can result in asphyxiation if in a controlled space.

OPERATIONS
----------

EVERSOURCE WILL BE NOTIFIED RIGHT AWAY

1. Units responding shall request wind direction and speed. 
2. Units responding shall confirm that Eversource has been notified.
3. Command will be established and a Safety Officer assigned. 
4. Units will approach from the windward (up- wind) side whenever possible. 
5. Evacuate any civilians in the area of escaping gas.  
6. All ignition sources should be identified and turned off whenever possible.  
7. Full protective gear will be worn including SCBA.  
8. Crews will monitor for any LEL readings. 
9. Crews will NEVER turn gas back on.  
10. If an explosion has occurred and gas is burning, do not extinguish the burning gas.  
11. Non-sparking tools should be used.
