purpose: "To set department policy on Line of Duty Death / Catastrophic Injury."
---

This SOG has been established to assist and direct officers and firefighter’s thoughts and actions along with initiating some very important steps yet still being able to mitigate the incident to which the fire company responded to and to proceed to the actions needed to assure that all requirements be met out of respect for the fallen or seriously injured firefighter and his/ her family.  This SOG has been divided into two sections.  The first section deals with the line of death duty death.  The second section deals with catastrophic injury.  The format for each section may be used as a checklist to make it easier for the fire company’s administration and chief officers to follow and complete all notifications, investigations, and follow up that are or may be required.
