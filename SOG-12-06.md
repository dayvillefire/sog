To provide policies outlining patient rights and Dayville Fire Company’s responsibilities in fulfilling patient requests.  Security of PHI is everyone’s responsibility."
---

The Dayville Fire Company retains strict requirements on the security, access, disclosure and use of PHI.  Access and disclosure and use of PHI will be based on the role of the individual staff member in the organization, and should be only to the extent that the person needs access to PHI to complete necessary job functions.  
When PHI is accessed, disclosure, and used, the individuals involved will make every effort, except in patient care situations, to only access, disclose and use PHI to the extent that only the minimum necessary information is used to accomplish the intended purpose.  
Patients may exercise their rights to access, amend, restrict, and request an accounting, as well as lodge a complaint with either the Dayville Fire Company or the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services.  

PROCEDURE
=========

Role Based Access 
-----------------
Access to PHI will be limited to those who need access to PHI to carry out their duties.  The following describes the specific categories or types of PHI to which such persons need access is defined and the conditions, as appropriate, that would apply to such access.  

| Job Title | Description of PHI to Be Accessed | Conditions of Access to PHI |
| --- | --- | --- |
| EMT/ EMR | Intake forms from dispatch, patient care reports | May access only as part of completion of a patient event and post- event activities and only while on active duty |
| F.I.T. Coordinator | Intake forms from dispatch, patient care reports | May access only as a part of training and quality assurance activities.  All individually identifiable patient information should be redacted prior to use in training and quality assurance activities |
| Department Managers | | May access only to the extent necessary to monitor compliance and to accomplish appropriate supervision and management of personnel |

Access to PHI is limited to the above- identified persons only, and to the identified PHI only, based on the Company’s reasonable determination of the persons or classes of persons who require PHI, and the nature of the health information they require, consistent with their job opportunities.  
Access to a patient’s entire file will not be allowed except when expressly permitted by a company policy or approved by the EMS- Assistant Chief.  

Disclosure to and Authorizations from the Patient
-------------------------------------------------

1. You are not required to limit your disclosure to the minimum amount of information necessary when disclosing PHI to other health care providers for treatment of the patient.  This includes doctors, nurses, etc. at the receiving hospital, any mutual aid provider, your fellow crew members involved in the call, and any other person involved in the treatment of the patient who has a need to know the patient’s PHI.  In addition, disclosures authorized by the patient are exempt from the minimum necessary requirements unless the authorization to disclose PHI is requested by the Company. 
2. Authorizations received directly from third parties, such as Medicare, or other insurance companies, which direct you to release PHI to those entities, are not subject to the minimum necessary standards.   For example, if we have a patient’s authorization to disclose PHI to Medicare, Medicaid, or another health insurance plan for claim determination purposes, the Company is permitted to disclose the PHI requested without making any minimum necessary determination.  
3. For all other uses and disclosures of PHI, the minimum necessary rule is likely to apply.  A good example of when the minimum necessary rule applies is when your Company conducts quality assurance activities.  In most situations, it is not necessary to disclose certain patient information such as the patient’s name, address, social security number, all PHI of treated patient to conduct a call review.  This sensitive information should be redacted or blacked out from the PCR being used as a Q/A example.  

Incidental Disclosures
----------------------

1. The Company understands that there will be times when there are incidental disclosures about the PHI in the context of caring for a patient.  The privacy laws were not intended to impede common health care practices that are essential in providing health care to the individual.  Incidental disclosures are inevitable, but these will typically occur in radio or face to face conversation between the health care providers, or when patient care information in written or computer form is left out in the open for others to access or see.  
2. The fundamental principle is that all staff needs to be sensitive about the importance of maintaining the confidence and security of all material we create or use that contains patient care information.  Coworkers and other staff members should not have access to information that is not necessary for the staff member to complete his or her job.  For example, it is generally not appropriate for field personnel to have access to billing records of the patient.  
3. However, all personnel must be sensitive to avoiding incidental disclosures to other health care providers and others who do not have a need to know the information.  Pay attention to who is within earshot when you make verbal statements about a patient’s health information, and follow some of these common-sense procedures for avoiding accidental or inadvertent disclosures.  

Verbal Security
---------------

1. Garage Areas - Staff members should be sensitive to that fact that members of the public and other agencies may be present in the garage and other easily accessible areas.  Conversations about patients and their health care should not take place in areas where those without a need to know are present.  
2. Other Areas -  Staff members should only discuss patient care information with those who are involved in the care of the patient, regardless of your physical location.  You should be sensitive to your level of voice and to the fact that others may be in the area when you are speaking.  This approach is not meant to impede anyone’s ability to speak with other health care providers freely when engaged in the care of the patient.  When it comes to treatment of the patient, you should be free to discuss all aspects of the patient’s medical condition, treatment provided, and any of their health information you may have in your possession with others involved in the care of the patient.  

Physical Security 
-----------------

1. Patient Care -  Patient care reports should be stored in safe and secure areas.  When any paper records concerning, a patient are completed, they should not be left in open bins or on desktops or other surfaces.  Only those with a need to have the information for the completion of their job duties should have access to any paper records.  
2. Computers and Entry Devices -  Computer access terminals and other remote entry devices such as PDAs and laptops should be kept secure.  Access to any computer device should be by password only. Staff members should be sensitive to who may be in viewing range of the monitor screen by unauthorized persons.  All remote devices such as laptops and PDAs should remain in the physical possession of the individual to whom it is assigned at all times.  

Penalties for Violation 
-----------------------

1. The department takes its responsibility to safeguard patient information very seriously.  There are significant legal penalties against companies and individuals that do not adhere to the laws that protect patient privacy.  
2. Members who do not follow our policies on patient privacy will be subject to disciplinary action, up to and including verbal and written warnings, suspension and/ or termination of the organization.  The Company shall make every effort to provide remedial education and training as to our policies and procedures when there is a first-time violation of our policies.  

Questions About This Policy
---------------------------

1. The Company has appointed a Privacy Officer to oversee our policies and procedures on a patient privacy and to monitor compliance.  The Privacy Officer is also available to you for consultation on any issues or concerns you have about how our Company deals with protected health information.  You should feel free to contact the Privacy Officer at any time with your questions or concerns.  
2. The Department will not retaliate against any staff member who expresses a good concern or complaint about any policy or practice related to the safeguarding of patient information and the Company’s legal obligations to protect patient privacy.
