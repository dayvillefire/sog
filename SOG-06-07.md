approved: "06-24-2008"
purpose: "To describe the department policy on post-incident critique."
---

The purpose of this S.O.G. is to provide a guideline governing post- incident critiques of emergency incident operations.  The post- incident critique system is a means of providing specific information to all personnel to allow them to benefit from the experience gained from a particular incident in an incident in an effort to improve operations at similar, future incidents.  

A critique shall be completed for all working fire as well as for any other incidents where it will benefit the company and/ or any individual.  

The critique is to be produced without the use of individual names; references are to be made by unit designation whenever possible.  

CRITIQUE CONTENTS
-----------------

* Incident Command System (ICS)
  - State the command post and staging location
  - Indicate what parts of the ICS were used (such as operations, safety, EMS control, rescue, public information, etc.) and describe the assignment and action of each.  
  - List any sectors that were established, including the sector commanders, units and assigned functions.  
  - Problems Encountered 
    - List specific operational problems encountered throughout the incident; for example, blocked Siamese connections, barred windows, false ceilings, inoperative hydrant, accelerants used, multiple fires set, triage problems, etc.  
* Lessons Learned and Reinforced
  - List the specific things that were done correctly and worked well.
  - List the ways the operation could be improved or possible solutions to the problems.  Items should not be listed in a negative manner but should be presented positively for the purpose of providing a means of improving operations in the future.  
* Summary
  - Give a brief overall summary of the incident.
