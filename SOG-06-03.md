In all cases of vehicle extrication, the primary concern is safety to life.  Patient condition, his/ her situation, hazards, and available resources will influence the methods and speed at which the operation will be accomplished.  It is recognized that the patient’s recovery is directly influenced by the pre- hospital care and time taken to get that patient to a hospital.  That time is measured from the time of the incident to the time of the patient’s arrival to a hospital.  The following guideline will be used&colon;
