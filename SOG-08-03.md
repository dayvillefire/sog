To ensure the safety of Junior Members, patients, and the public while on-scene of emergency and non-emergency calls, work details, etc. 

The Dayville Fire District (DFD) welcomes adolescents between the age of 14 and 17 to serve in the fire department.  We feel that it offers the students an unparalleled opportunity to serve the public in a meaningful way while learning new skills and interacting with their peers who have the same interests.  Due to the nature of firefighting, and the dangers that can be involved with some of these activities, we have developed guidelines meant to protect the students during their participation.  We recognize the importance of education and the building of character during this developmental period of their lives.  The following guidelines have also been designed to encourage these aspects while they participate in Dayville Fire Company activities.   

Junior Program Application
--------------------------

The Dayville Fire Company Chief will appoint one of more Junior Program Advisors (JPAs).  The JPAs may be Senior, Associate, or Probationary Firefighters.  JPA’s responsibilities include&colon;

* Developing and implementing a training program for Junior Firefighters. (JFFs)
* Encouraging and guide the growth of individual JFFs through the program.  
* Appointing each JFF with a mentor for whom they can go to for any problems that would not directly need to be handled by the JPA or the Chief Officer.  
* Monitoring individual JFF compliance with scholastic, behavior and participation requirements and taking appropriate action when JFFs fail to comply.  
* Maintaining effective communication with JFF parents/ guardians. 
* Recruiting new JFFs.  
* Reporting to Officers and the Membership Committee, as appropriate, on both the overall program and individual JFF’s progress.  
* Providing recommendations to the Membership Committee regarding awards and recognition of JFFs.  
* Providing a recommendation to the Membership Committee when a JFF reaches eligibility for regular membership.

Admission to Junior Application
-------------------------------

* The admission process begins when the candidate submits a completed “Application for Junior Membership”.  Note&colon;  To be considered for Junior Membership, the candidate must be fourteen (14) years of age and older but less than eighteen (18) years of age.  
* The membership application package should include a completed Department Parent Permission Slip, to be filled out by the junior member’s parent/ legal guardian which states the states that the junior member can participate in fire department functions, including but not limited to&colon; emergency and non-emergency responses (when JFF becomes eligible to respond to calls), fire department training sessions, fire department work details, and station/ member duties.  
* The Membership Committee ensures that the application is complete and the candidate meets all requirements for membership (including academic performance), then recommends the candidate for acceptance at a regularly scheduled monthly department meeting.  
* The JPAs should schedule a meeting with the new JFF and his/ her parent or guardian as soon as practical.  The purpose of the meeting is to ensure that all parties concerned are fully informed of their roles and responsibilities.  
* JFFs are on probation for the entire time they are junior members.  Upon reaching 18 years of age, the member may begin a 3-month probationary period to become a full-time department member.  

Requirements to Maintain Junior Membership
------------------------------------------

* To join or remain in the Junior Firefighter Program, the JFF must achieve a grade of “C” or above in all subjects each school quarter.  It is the JFF’s responsibility to submit a copy of his/ her quarterly report card to the JPA as soon as practical after report cards have been issued.  Report card copies will be filed in the department records and treated as confidential documents.  
* If a JFF receives a failing grade, in any subject, he/ she is automatically placed on administrative leave from all Dayville Fire Company activities.  
* If a JFF receives a “D” letter grade in any subject, the JPAs will review the report card and decide whether some restriction of the JFF’s participation in department activities is appropriate.  For example, the JFF may be restricted from responding to calls, but allowed to participate in training activities.  They may also identify additional activities the JFF could perform in order to bring his/ her grades up such as regularly reporting test scores to the JPAs or participating in tutoring sessions with knowledgeable senior firefighter.  The JPAs should choose restrictions/ activities judiciously to be proportional to the seriousness of the academic shortfall (for example, receiving a “D” in a major subject vs a minor subject, first occurrence vs. multiple quarters with a “D” grade), as well as to enhance the JFF’s educational experience and sense of personal responsibility.  The restrictions/ activities should be discussed with and endorsed with the Membership Committee/ Department Officers before putting them into effect.  
* When administrative leave or restrictions/ activities have been imposed on a JFF, they remain in effect until the JFF receives a report card or a progress report showing that all grades are of a “C” or higher.  At the earliest convenience after administrative leave or restrictions/ activities have been imposed, the JPAs should schedule a meeting with the JFF and a parent or guardian to ensure that all parties understand what has been agreed upon and why and what is expected of the JFF to make a successful transition back to unrestricted status.  
* Expulsion from school will be grounds for automatic dismissal from the Junior Firefighter Program.  

Behavioral requirements
-----------------------

* JFFs are expected to conduct themselves in a manner consistent with being a public servant&colon; 
* No obscene, vulgar or crude language or behavior on Dayville Fire District property or while participating in Dayville Fire District activities.  
* No use or influence of alcohol, tobacco, or drugs while on Dayville Fire District property, while participating in Dayville Fire District activities or while wearing Dayville Fire District apparel.  
* Any JFF accused or convicted of the possession, sale, or distribution of a controlled substance is subject to discipline, including dismissal.  
* Any arrest or conviction will be grounds for denial of membership, or dismissal.  

Participation Requirements
--------------------------

* JFFs are required to follow all fire department policies, procedures, and guidelines and conform to the standards of the Dayville Fire District.  
* To be considered for a 3-month probation, a JFF must attend a minimum of 40% of all announced Junior Training offerings and monthly department meetings, and respond to a reasonable number of calls/ department activities.  
* JFFs are required to complete the following training classes&colon;

  - Bloodborne, Airborne and Hazard Communication Training
  - Scene Safety

* If a JFF needs transportation to or from any call or fire department function, the JFF’s parents/ legal guardian will be required to provide transportation for them.  All Dayville Fire Company members are not allowed to provide transportation for any JFF unless they are designated by the parent/ legal guardian on a written permission slip which is signed and given to the Fire Chief, unless directed by a Chief Officer.  

Parent Communication
--------------------

* The parents/ guardians of our JFFs are entitled to understand how our program works and how their JFF is progressing.  Furthermore, parental support can contribute positively to the success of the JFF and therefore to the Junior Program in general.  Therefore, it benefits the department to provide clear communications.  The JFAs should aim to schedule a meeting once a year with each JFF and his/ her parent/ guardians.
