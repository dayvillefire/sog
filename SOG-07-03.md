purpose: "To describe the department policy on cleaning/ decontamination of protective clothing and equipment."

The purpose of this S.O.G. is to establish guidelines to&colon; 

* Prevent the spread of contaminants encountered while using protective clothing and equipment.
* Protect responders, their families, and the public from exposure to toxins and carcinogens. 
* Prolong the life and maximize the protective qualities of gear.  

Spoiled protective equipment can expose emergency workers, their families, and the public to toxins and carcinogens that may enter the body through ingestion, inhalation, and absorption.  For this reason, laundering of protective clothing shall not be performed in members’ home or public facilities. 

Protective clothing that is heavily soiled reflects less radiant heat, is more likely to conduct electricity may lose flame resistance, and have a shorter service life.   

It is no longer considered true that dirty and worn out firefighting equipment is a sign of an experienced firefighter.  It is now a sign of an under-educated firefighter and a potential liability to the Dayville Fire Company.  

Protective clothing and equipment should be cleaned as soon as possible after any use where it has been soiled or potentially contaminated.  

Items to be cleaned&colon; coat, pants, liner, protective hood, turnout bag, helmet, gloves, boots, coveralls, goggles, and safety glasses.  

Laundering of protective clothing and cleaning of protective equipment should only be done at laundry facilities located at the station or other approved locations which have been specifically designated for this purpose.  

**Never clean protective clothing in the upstairs sink.**

Wash liners and outer garments in separate loads to minimize contamination of the liners.  

Gloves and turnout bags may be washed with outer garments.  

Protective hoods may be washed with liner garments. 

During washing of helmets, boots, and goggles, appropriate hand and eye protection shall be worn.  

Any items contaminated with blood or bodily fluids require an additional level of cleaning.  See Dayville Fire Company “Bloodborne Pathogen Compliance Program” for these procedures.  

Any items contaminated at a hazardous material incident require an additional level of cleaning or decontamination.  This must be determined before contaminated items leave the hazard zone.  The level of cleaning decontamination at hazardous material incident may vary based on the type of contaminant.
