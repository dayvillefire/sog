It is the policy of the Company to minimize the risk of injury to a member whenever possible, and this includes situations that arise in the station.  Should an emergency develop that is or has the potential of injury or death to an individual, the station will be evacuated until additional assistance arrives.  Evacuation will be through designated exits, located as follows&colon;

A)  2nd Floor Meeting, Training, and Conference Rooms- Exit through the doorway to the interior staircases which leads to the front of the building and the ramp area.  
B)  1st Floor Apparatus Floor- Exit either through the doorway in the middle of the station that leads to the entrance foyer the out to the front of the building or the door that leads to the Chiefâ€™s parking area near the tracks.  

If the hazard affects the station, qualified drivers will attempt to remove apparatus as long as this action does not threaten the wellbeing of the driver.  In all cases, notification of the above will be made to the dispatcher by using a phone or radio outside of the building.  Should a member be injured, either in the station or t an emergency call, first aid will be administered by any qualified first medical personal, EMR or EMT.  In all cases, the injury will be reported to a Chief Officer and an Injury Report will be completed.  Should it be deemed necessary by the medical personnel, the member will be transported to a medical facility for further care. 

In all cases of evacuation, the senior officer present or senior member will account for all personnel in the building.  Personnel leaving the building will report to this person.  An initial staging area will be the parking lot near the tracks depending on condition.  All personnel are expected to gather there unless directed otherwise.
