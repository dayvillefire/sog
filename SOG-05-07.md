The purpose of this guideline is to avoid preventable accidents using a standardized backing procedure.  

Backing of fire company vehicles should be avoided whenever possible.  Where backing is unavoidable, a spotter shall be used for all vehicles.  When the vehicle is manned by only the driver, he/ she shall attempt to utilize any available fire company personnel to act as spotters.  Where no personnel are available to assist, the driver shall make a complete 360-degree survey of the area around his/her vehicle to determine if any obstructions are preset, prior to backing the vehicle.  

Spotters will discuss the backup plan with the driver before proceeding.  The communication and warning process will be agreed to upon prior to backing.  
When backing, the spotter should be located off the left rear corner. The vehicle shall to be backed until the spotter is in position and communicates approval to start backing.  Spotters will remain visible to the driver.  

**Anytime the driver loses sight of the spotter, the vehicle shall be stopped immediately.**

Backing will resume when the spotter is visible.  Company policy prohibits tailboard riding at any time.  

When vehicles must be backed up where other vehicle traffic exists, the vehicleâ€™s emergency lights shall be operating.  Spotters and/or Fire Police shall wear orange safety vests.  Spotters and/or Fire Police will verify that all traffic has come to a complete stop before proceeding. 

During night backing, the spotter will assure that the spotlights on the rear of the apparatus if equipped are turned on before allowing the apparatus to be backed.  A flashlight may be carried, but at no time will it be directed toward the mirror.  

The spotter at no time will use confusing hand signals.  If the driver is in doubt, the vehicle will be stopped immediately.  

The company officer will ensure that their crew members are properly trained.
