Preparation and Response
------------------------

* All calls will be dispatched in accordance with current policy and members may respond. However, there will be a limit of 3 members in the rescue for medical calls, if deemed necessary by the officer. Some calls may say “universal precautions required.”
* First responder personnel required to use PPE must be trained. This training includes when to use PPE; what PPE is necessary; how to properly don (put on), use, and doff (take off) PPE; how to properly dispose of or disinfect, inspect for damage, and maintain PPE; and the limitations of PPE
* First responder personnel recognizing a potentially infectious patient should notify the PSAP (Public Safety Answering Points) to ensure the en-route ambulance responders are prepared to implement appropriate infection prevention and control measures.  

On Scene / Transport
--------------------

* Members will attempt contact the ambulance crew, if already on scene, without entering the home, via radio transmission and ask if they are needed. If the ambulance crew indicates they are all set, the crew is to return without making contact with the patient. 
* In the event that the Ambulance is not on scene yet, the crew will send two (2) individuals in the home to assess the severity of the call and whether additional personnel are needed.
* First responder personnel that initiate or are part of patient care should be limited to the maximum number of two (2) personnel inside, unless otherwise required, to provide proper care and transport of the patient.
* Attempt to maintain at least six (6) feet of separation from the patient (if condition allows) when performing initial screening to minimize the risk of droplet transmission.
* Initiate standard contact and airborne precautions (gloves, surgical mask, and goggles/face shield)  for EMS clinicians in direct contact with the patient.
* Initiate airborne and contact precautions (N-95 and gown) for EMS clinicians direct patient contact, if deemed necessary by the officer.
* Instruct patient to don a procedure mask to reduce droplet transmission (do NOT apply N-95 respirators to patients)
* If indicated, oxygen via nasal cannula may be administered under the procedure mask.
* If indicated, an oxygen mask may be used in place of a procedure mask.
* Use caution with aerosol generating procedures (nebulized medications, intubation, suctioning, CPR, etc.)
* If for any reason our crew believes the call will end up being a refusal then they are to ask the ambulance crew to remain outside until either needed or released. Non medically certified members are not to respond to medicals unless directed to do so by an officer.
* Properly doff PPE, clean and disinfect equipment and dispose of material according to agency protocol/policy.
* First responder personnel who wear proper personal protective equipment (PPE) while managing and/or transporting a symptomatic individual are considered to have a low-risk exposure according to the CDC and continue to work without interruption. This includes proper removal, disposal and decontamination. Proper PPE&colon; Surgical gloves, Goggles or disposable full-face shield, surgical gowns, and N-95 or greater masks (for those directly engaged in patient care).
* EMS personnel who have been exposed to a patient with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 should notify their chain of command to ensure appropriate follow-up. Any unprotected exposure (e.g., not wearing recommended PPE) should be reported to occupational health services, a supervisor, or a designated infection control officer for evaluation.
* Members will be provided updated CDC information on personal and family protective measures to observe during the quarantine process.
* Clean and disinfect reusable patient-care equipment according to manufacturer’s instructions before use on another patient.
* Follow standard operating procedures for the containment and disposal of used PPE and regulated medical waste.
* Incident documentation should include a listing of EMS and firefighters involved in the response and level of contact with the patient (e.g., no contact with patient, provided direct patient care). Always consider exposure reporting and First Report of Injury/Illness (FRI) documentation when appropriate.
* EMS clinicians should be alert for fever or respiratory symptoms (e.g., cough, shortness of breath, sore throat). If symptoms develop, they should self-isolate and notify occupational health services and/or their public health authority to arrange for appropriate evaluation.

Restrictions, which can be applied at the Chiefs discretion
-----------------------------------------------------------

* Drills/trainings are suspended until further notice.
* Juniors are prohibited from being on calls.
* Members can come and go freely from the firehouse. However, they are not to congregate as groups for “hang out” all together otherwise firehouse access will be limited to calls only.
* Nonmembers other than immediate family members are not permitted inside the firehouse.
* Lastly, if anyone, for any reason at all, feel sick or believe you may have been in contact with someone who has or is suspected of having COVID-19 or feels they are high risk, notify the Fire Chief immediately and should stay home and take care of themselves.
