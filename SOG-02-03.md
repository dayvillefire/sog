* All in-service bunk members will report to the first floor and critique the call for 5-10 minutes.  
* After the critique the officer in charge will issue the member who missed the call an as the assignment. 
* The assignment will be dependent upon the environmental conditions and type of call (i.e. wash the windows on apparatus, fill bottles, wash tools after working incident). 
* The goal for this procedure is to promote a team concept within the bunkroom as well as throughout the station.  All members are encouraged to look out for each other and wake each other up for calls.  This will enable us to provide the proper service to our citizens and safety for own people as the other member must compensate for the loss of the person sleeping during a working incident and creating a greater potential for personal injury.    
* If an individual repeatedly sleeps through calls, the Fire Chief will evaluate that the member’s sleep-in status which may result in disciplinary actions.
