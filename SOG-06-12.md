purpose: "To establish a guideline for responding to Flammable Liquid Incidents."

Four primary areas of concern are&colon;
1. Extinguishment of flammable liquid fires
2. Spills without fire
3. Disposal
4. Firefighter safety

EXTINGUISHMENT
--------------

The preferred agent for flammable liquid firefighting is AFFF/ Class B foam.  Fire attack on any flammable liquid should be made with Class B foam or if the fuel is ethanol, or ethanol base, fire attack should utilize an Alcohol Resistant Film Forming Foam (AR-AFFF). 

SPILLS
------

Flammable liquid spills must be protected from all ignition sources.   Vehicles should be positioned to prevent contact of vapor with running engines or exhaust.  Cover spills with Class B foam to seal vapors.  The foam may need to be reapplied as the seal will break down in 10 to 15 minutes.  DO NOT permit flammable liquid to run off into sewers, rivers, or drainage systems. 

DISPOSAL
--------

Notify DEP through QVEC of all spills.  Small spills may be absorbed with absorbent pads. 

SAFETY
------

A Hot Zone should be established and marked with Hazard tape.  This area should include the spilled area downwind of the spill of sufficient distance to account for reasonable vapor travel.  

A Warm Zone may be needed that surrounds the Hot Zone in which a lesser degree of risk exists. 

All personnel must wear full protective clothing, including SCBA.  Command must be established and a Safety Officer must be assigned.
