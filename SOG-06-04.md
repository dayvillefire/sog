The purpose of this guideline is to assist the Crystal Water Company in providing a water flow that is sufficient for the various needs of the company.  Crystal Water wants to be notified of any fire situation requiring large water flows.  This can be done through QVEC.  

When the drills are conducted using a hydrant, Crystal Water should be notified one week in advance, especially if water flow will exceed more than 500 gallons.  

The hydrant valves are to be fully open or fully closed.  The hydrant valves open counter clockwise.  Operating a hydrant partially open can cause a pressurized flow through the drain, disturbing the earth around the hydrant.  Excessive force should not be necessary, particularly when seating the valve in the closed position.  A firm, not forceful motion is all that is necessary.  

Soft suction hose is all that is necessary.  

When operating at a fire or a drill, do not draw the hydrant below 20 PSI.  After closing a hydrant, allow it to drain until there is no vacuum pull against your hand on a 2 Â½ outlet.  Also listen carefully to ensure that the valve is seated and no water is passing. 

Crystal Water will be notified as soon as possible after the incident and/ or drills of the following&colon;    
* Approximate water use in gallons
* Hydrant location
* Purpose of the water flow
* Any problems that have arisen
