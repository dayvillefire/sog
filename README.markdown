# STANDARD OPERATING GUIDELINES

Project to standardize formatting for Dayville Fire Company Standard Operating Guidelines using TeX.

Heavily based off of the work done here : https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/22532/template-for-standard-operating-procedures

## Caveats

* Pandoc doesn't like colons in Markdown, so all Markdown sources will have to use ``&colon;``
* Use [Edotor](https://edotor.net/) to create GraphViz graphs and convert to SVG.
