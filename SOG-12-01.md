Emergency Medical Services (EMS) providers strive every day to deliver the highest standard of emergency medical services to the people of Connecticut. 
Please note that the proposed guidelines are not mandatory for Connecticut EMS agencies.  The guidelines and procedures manual is meant to assist in the development of local protocols. The guidelines were updated and will be periodically reviewed by the EMS Advisory Board in order to maintain the most current information available.  
 
These guidelines are an annex to the current version of the State of Connecticut EMS Guidelines document.  They can be used by Emergency Medical Responders (EMRs) who initiate care until the patient is transferred to the care of a higher level of EMS professional or medical professional in the prehospital setting.  A higher level of emergency medical services should be dispatched immediately to activate a response by a higher level of EMS professional.   Medical direction can at any time and for any reason and should be contacted as soon as possible for deterioration in patient condition.
