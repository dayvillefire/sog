Corrective action is the process designed to identify and correct problems that affect an employeeâ€™s work performance or the overall performance of the department. The progressive corrective action process should be handled consistently within each unit and for each problem.

GUIDELINES&colon;
The progressive corrective action process refers to the following actions&colon;

1.  Counseling or verbal warning
2.  Written reprimand and warning
3.  Suspension or suspension pending investigation and final determination
4.  Warning of termination
5.  Termination

These steps are usually taken in sequence when an employee exhibits behavior or performance issues. However, depending on the situation, any step may be repeated, omitted, or taken out of sequence. The Fire Company reserves the right to effect immediate termination/demotion should the situation be warranted. Each case is considered on an individual basis.

When issuing corrective action, there should be clear and direct communication between the employee and his/her immediate supervisor. This communication should include a meeting between the employee and the supervisor with another officer present.

In the case of serious misconduct, an employee may be suspended and/or discharged on the first offense. Serious workplace misconduct includes, but is not limited to the following.

* Theft
* Fighting
* Behavior/Language of a threatening, abusive, or inappropriate nature;
* Misuse, damage to, or loss of District Property;
* Falsification, alteration, or improper handling of company related records;
* Unsatisfactory customer service;
* Disclosure or misuse of confidential material;
* Unauthorized possession or concealment of weapons;
* Insubordination (disobeying a direct lawful and safe assignment);
* Misuse of the company electronic information systems;
* Possession, use, sale, manufacture, purchase, or working under the influence of non-prescription or illegal drugs, alcohol, or other intoxicants

This policy is intended to instill but not limit the specific levels of corrective actions management can impose. This will be based on the significance of the infraction and the rank of the supervisor involved. The Chief of the Fire Company has ultimate latitude to make changes as he /she sees fit.
