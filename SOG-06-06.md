title: "Two In / Two Out Policy"
approved: "06-24-2008"
purpose: "To set department policy in OSHA requirements concerning two in/ two out for interior firefighting operations."
---

The purpose of this guideline is to establish guidelines for the implementation of OSHA 29 CFR 1920.134- Two In/ Two Out Rule and its application during emergency operations.  This “Two In/ Two Out” rule provides for rapid rescue of initial entry personnel operating in the Immediately Dangerous to Life and Health atmosphere (IDLH).  

The Federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) has established set of compliance instructions regarding the number of firefighters required to be present on the fire ground prior to commencing an interior attack on a structure fire.  This compliance notice known as “Two In/ Two Out” requires a stand-by team of at least two members to be organized to back up the entry of two members before the initial attack into and IDLH atmosphere.  These members shall be fully equipped with appropriate clothing, SCBA, and any specialized rescue equipment that might be needed given the specifics of the operation under way. 

Therefore, there must be at least four individuals on scene at the incident to initiate interior firefighting operations in an IDLH scenario.  

Exception
---------

An exception to the “Two In/ Two Out” rule may be taken only for life rescue given the following criteria&colon;
* You have information that an immediate risk to life safety exists within the interior IDLH atmosphere.
* You have realistic expectations of successfully performing a rescue.

COMPANY OPERATION
-----------------

Entry Team Members operating in hazardous areas at emergency incidents shall operate in teams of two or more and be equipped with SCBA.  Team members shall be in communication with each other through visual, audible, physical or safety guide rope to coordinate their activities.  Communication between the two-member team making entry is not allowed by radio, therefore, team members must be in close proximity to each other to provide assistance in case of emergency.  

NFPA 1404, appendix 5.1.4(2) states&colon;  
This program will develop the ability of an individual to manage his or her air consumption as part of a team during a work period.  This can require team members to rotate positions of heavy work to light work so air consumption is equalized among team members.  The individual air management program should include the following directives&colon;
* Exit from an IDLH atmosphere should be before consumption of reserve air supply begins.
* Low air alarm is notification that the individual is consuming the reserve air supply. 
* Activation of the reserve air alarm is an immediate action item for the individual and the team. 

All firefighters are out of the fire (the IDLH atmosphere) before their low air warning alarm activates.  If the low air warning while they are inside the hazardous environment, then this is an immediate action item- comparable to a “Mayday” or firefighter emergency.  

Standby Team Members shall be in communication with each other through visual or audible means (other than radio communications) to coordinate their activities.  Only one of the two stand by team members outside the LDLH atmosphere may be engaged in secondary duties.  For example, an Operation Officer, Incident Commander, or other qualified member, may fill a stand by position provided that their primary focus is to be dressed for and ready to perform a rescue from the IDLH atmosphere.  The stand by member may only be involved in secondary duties if abandoning those duties does not jeopardize the safety or health of any member on scene.  No one shall be engaged to serve as a stand by member when other activities to which they are engaged inhibit their ability to assist in performing a rescue, or are of such importance that they cannot be abandoned without placing other firefighters in danger. 

RAPID INTERVENTION CREW
-----------------------

The Dayville Fire Company will provide personnel for the rescue members performing interior operations involving IDLH atmospheres.  The Incident Commander will request through Q.V. Dispatch Center an R.I.C. from a department that has been properly trained as soon as possible.  A stand by team will be established until the R.I.C. has been established on scene.  

ACCOUNTABILITY
--------------

It is the responsibility of each member to follow the requirements set forth by the Dayville Fire Company concerning accountability as described in S.O.G. D-5 Fire Ground Operations.
